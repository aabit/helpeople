**Synopsis of volunteeRocks Application:**

The volunteeRocks web application is designed to link volunteers to opportunities near them! 

Organizations can post opportunities which will include a title, the location, and the number of volunteers needed.

Volunteers can search opportunities by zip code. They will then be able to view a list of available opportunities in that area. Volunteers can add themselves to the opportunity of their choice.
