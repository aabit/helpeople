The volunteeRocks web application is designed to link volunteers to opportunities near them! 

Organizations can post opportunities which will include a title and description of the volunteer opportunity, the location, and the number of volunteers needed. 

Volunteers can search an area by zip code. They will then be able to view a list of available opportunities in that area. Volunteers can then click and add themselves to the opportunity of their choosing if volunteers are still needed.

Release Notes (what is currently working):
        Currently volunteers can sign up using their name, location, and email address. 
        A volunteer can also be edited or deleted.
